# Smart-Parking-Allocation-Zone-Management-System
This project focuses on designing and implementing an in-memory smart parking system  for a city divided into zones. The system manages parking requests, allocates parking slots  based on availability and zone constraints, enforces strict request lifecycles, supports  rollback for cancellations, and provides usage analytics.
